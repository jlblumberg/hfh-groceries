- Nearby shops will appear on a map with a pin that when clicked will show the relevant information
- Sainsburys selected as a proof of concept, to be expanded in future work
- Relevant information:
  - Display all opening hours for selected shop 
  - Display the hours the shop is open for NHS/key workers/vulnerable individuals
